Figured out why asking for space is not sufficient. Who is asking makes a big
deal of difference. For instance if a big robot requires a smaller robot to ask
for space, then the small robot should clear all space for it.

But if a small robot is blocking a bigger space, then the robots should try to
make do with the smallest common tile-size for planning.
